\subsubsection{Notes}

For each of the datasets, an 'Import ASTERIX Recording' task is started, in the configuration that was set previously. Please make sure that the configuration is valid for such processing. \\

For the filename in each dataset, the absolute path is searched first. If such a file can not be found, a file with the same name but in the location of the view point file is searched also. If the referred file can not be found, an error message is displayed. \\

It is not recommended to import multiple view point files, such a use case is not yet fully supported.

Using the 'Import' button a process is started to import the view points and ASTERIX data recordings. \\
