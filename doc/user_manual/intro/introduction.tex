\chapter{Introduction}

The OpenATS COMPASS tool aims at providing a generalized framework for ATC surveillance data inspection and analysis. \\

It’s name being an abbreviation for \textbf{comp}liance \textbf{ass}essment, the OpenATS COMPASS tool allows air traffic surveillance recordings to be imported into a database for analysis, visualization and evaluation.

Many use-cases are supported, e.g. importing EUROCONTROL ASTERIX recordings into a database, textual \& visual analysis, evaluation (calculation of performance indicators) and evaluation report document generation.

The application is highly configurable and quite complex, and is developed for usage of air traffic surveillance professionals. To support new users, a user manual as well as YouTube videos are supplied.

The C++ code is released under the GPL-3.0, while the Linux AppImage and the user manual are released under CC BY 4.0.

OpenATS COMPASS is publicly available and free for anyone to use (including commercial usage), under the previously stated licenses.

Please \textbf{note} that COMPASS was previously called ATSDB, and includes all functionality previously present in ATSDB. \\

\section{User Manual}

This document has its focus on interaction and working procedures required to make use of the existing
functionality. In this introduction, feature highlights and ackknowledgments are listed, followed by a brief summary of important aspects of  COMPASS in \nameref{sec:key_concepts}. \\

In the section \nameref{sec:installation}, prerequisites are listed and installation instructions are given. \\

In the larger section \nameref{sec:main_window}, the steps are described to run the application, create a database or access an existing one, import and processing data beforte the start of the management GUI. How configured tasks can be executed automatically is described in \nameref{sec:command_line}. \\

How data can be loaded is described in the section \nameref{sec:load}. \\

The evaluation feature is described in the section \nameref{sec:eval}, describing how requirement-based standards can be adapted/defined and compliance to said standards can be assessed. \\

Re-visiting saved points of interest is described in section \nameref{sec:view_points}. Inspection of loaded data using the existing views is described in the sections \nameref{sec:listbox_view}, \nameref{sec:histo_view}, \nameref{sec:osg_view} and \nameref{sec:scatter_view}. \\

In the section \nameref{sec:troubleshooting} details about reported isses are collected, as well as details on how to report new issues. \\

In the last section \nameref{sec:appendix} additional details are given. In the section \nameref{sec:appendix_utils} some information is given how data can be manually imported into COMPASS. In the final section \nameref{sec:appendix_licensing} information is given about under what conditions COMPASS can be used and what 
libraries with what licences are used in the background.
