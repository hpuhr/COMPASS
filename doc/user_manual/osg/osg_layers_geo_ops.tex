 \item Show Siblings: Enable display of all sibling items (children of parent except this one)
 \item Clear Labels: Removes all labels
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Selection Operations}

\begin{itemize}
 \item Select Data: Select (only) target reports in the group
 \item Add Data to Selection: Add target reports in the group to selection
 \item Remove Data from Selection: Remove target reports in the group from selection
\end{itemize}

\paragraph{Association Operations}
If association information is present, and was generated by the selected layer, the following operations exist:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Show Assocations: Shows the associations of all target reports in the group
 \item Clear Association: Hides the associations of all target reports in the group
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Ground Lines Operations}
If height information is used, the following operations exist:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Show Ground Lines: Shows the connection lines to the ground for all target reports in the group.
 \item Clear Ground Lines: Clears the connection lines to the ground for all target reports in the group.
\end{itemize} 


\paragraph{Ground Speed Vector Operations}
If ground speed information is loaded (see \nameref{sec:others_ground_speed}), the following operations exist:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Show Ground Speed Vectors: Shows ground speed vectors for all target reports in the group.
 \item Clear Ground Lines: Clears ground speed vectors for all target reports in the group.
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Position Accuracy Ellipses Operations}
If position accuracy information is loaded (see \nameref{sec:others_position_accuracy}), the following operations exist:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Show Position Accuracy Ellipses: Shows position accuracy ellipses for all target reports in the group.
 \item Clear Position Accuracy Ellipses: Clears position accuracy ellipses for all target reports in the group.
\end{itemize} 

\paragraph{Special Root Geometry Layer Operations}
This layer has special operation present:

\begin{itemize}
 \item Reset All Styles: Sets all style information to default (including make all data visible)
 \item Clear All Assocations: Removes display of all shown associations of all data
\end{itemize}
