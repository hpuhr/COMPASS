\section{Configuration Upgrade}

If the used version of COMPASS has never been run on the workstation, the configuration (and additional application data) will be copied into a subfolder of the home directory (e.g. \textasciitilde/.compass/0.9.0/). \\

\includegraphics[width=0.5cm]{../../data/icons/hint.png} When switching from an older COMPASS version to a newer one, it is recommended to do a data sources export (see \nameref{sec:config_ds_export}) in the old version, 
and then an import in the new one. \\

For more details about the configuration, please refer to section \nameref{sec:appendix_configuration}.
