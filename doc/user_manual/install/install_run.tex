\section{Running the Application}

After an \nameref{sec:installation}, simply run the application.

For an AppImage, use e.g.:
\begin{lstlisting}
./COMPASS-release_x86_64.AppImage
\end{lstlisting}

For a self-built application, use e.g.:
\begin{lstlisting}
./build/bin/compass_client
\end{lstlisting}

It is recommended to run the application from a console terminal (for analysis of potential issues in the log text), but that is not mandatory.
