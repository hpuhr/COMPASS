COMPASS can either be built from source (which does not include the OSG View, but allows development of additional features), or downloaded as an \textit{AppImage} (binary distributable which includes the OSG View). The recommended option for non-developers is the AppImage. \\

However, there are a few prerequisites that should be taken into consideration.
