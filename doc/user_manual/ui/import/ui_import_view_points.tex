After selection of a view point file, a text field is shown, which displays the view point context information or an error message. \\

At the bottom, an 'Import' button exists, which is only enabled if a valid file was selected.

\subsubsection{Notes}

For a detailed specification of a view point file, please refer to \nameref{sec:appendix_view_points}. \\

For each of the datasets, an 'Import ASTERIX Recording' task is started, using the previously set configuration. Please make sure that the import configuration is valid for such processing. \\

For the filename in each dataset, the absolute path is searched first. If such a file cannot be found, a file with the same name at the location of the view point file is further searched. 
If the referred file cannot be found, an error message is displayed. \\

It is not recommended to import multiple view point files, such a use case is not fully supported yet.

Using the 'Import' button a process is started to import the view points and ASTERIX data recordings. \\
