\subsection{Import ASTERIX from Network}
\label{sec:ui_import_asterix_network}

This task allows importing ASTERIX data from the network into the opened database, and switches from 'Offline' to 'Live' mode. \\

Except for the differing ASTERIX source at the top, everything works the same as described in \nameref{sec:ui_import_asterix}. \\

When the import is started, data is continously read from the network (according to the data source network lines specificiation) and processed according to \nameref{sec:live_mode}.
