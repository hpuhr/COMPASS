\subsection{Reset Views}
\label{sec:ui_reset_views}

Using this feature, unsaved configuration changes can be reverted in the existing views. It can be used to restore a "default" state as existing at application startup (for the most important UI functions). \\

This function performs the following functions:
\begin{itemize}
 \item Enables all data sources
 \item Disables all filters
 \item Resets all Views to their startup configuration
\end{itemize}
\  \\

Please note that newly created Views are not deleted in this function, although deleted ones are restored.
